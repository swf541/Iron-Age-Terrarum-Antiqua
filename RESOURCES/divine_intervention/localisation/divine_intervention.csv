form_the_holy_see_desc;As the church's earthly holdings have grown in size, so has the Pope's influence. The time has come for the Throne of St. Peter to be above the thrones of man not only in the eyes of The Lord, but in the eyes of men as well. It is time for the formation of the Sancta Sedes - the Holy See. With this new title, even kings can be legally obligated to serve as vassals of the pope.;;;;;;;;;x
