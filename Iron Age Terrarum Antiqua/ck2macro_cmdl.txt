        Path for the macro files.
        Default value is ./macros
    path-file

        Default value is ck2macro_paths.txt in the path of the ck2macro.exe
        executable.
    
Other options:
    
    /? or /help
        Displays this help file.
    /inpath
        Specifies that the next parameter is the input-path.
    /outpath
        Specifies that the next parameter is the output-path.
    /macropath
        Specifies that the next parameter is the macro-path.
    /pathfile
        Specifies that the next parameter is the path-file.
    /cleardst
        Clears destination paths in the output-path before processing scripts.
        Where the path-file mentions specific files or search patterns, these
        will be deleted in the destination directories. Where the path-file
        mentions directories, all .txt files in that destination directory will
        be deleted. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS AND CHECK THE PATHS FILE FIRST
        TO BE SURE YOU WON'T OVERWRITE ANYTHING IMPORTANT. By default this
        option is off.
